#iOS Automata Suite: 




This is just me getting used to swift, xcode and ios development.

The final (if it is finished) application should be able to implement automata on a dynamic canvas and address their properties.




Target build is iOS mobiles.


The application is straight forward. 


Emphasis is put on using swift specific constructs; This project should not be taken as representative of the most efficient method for implementing any function.

Notes:

Automata names and identities are their unique user-chosen Strings; this is done for user comfort friends.
